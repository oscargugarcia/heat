Description: The R package heat - Harmonized Environmental Exposure Aggregation Tools - provides a comprehensive set of tools to compute environmental exposures for administrative boundaries or point locations. Its main aggregation function, `r2e2`, supports various nonlinear transformations (e.g., polynomial, splines, binning), temporal aggregations (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly), and scales efficiently to large raster datasets spanning multiple decades.
