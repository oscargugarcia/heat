\title{Mean Interpolation for Daily Temperature Values}
\usage{
mean_interpolation(tmin, tmax)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmin}{A numeric vector of daily minimum temperatures, where each value
corresponds to a day. When used with rasters, this represents the
values from the tmin raster layers.}

\item{tmax}{A numeric vector of daily maximum temperatures, where each value
corresponds to a day. When used with rasters, this represents the
values from the tmax raster layers. Must be the same length as tmin.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the computed mean temperatures for each day.
The length of the returned vector equals the length of the input vectors.
When used with rasters, the output layers retain the same names as the
input tmin layers, formatted as dates.
}
\description{
This function computes a simple mean interpolation from daily minimum and
maximum temperature values by calculating the arithmetic mean (tmin + tmax) / 2
for each day. This provides a single representative daily temperature value
that falls halfway between the daily extremes.
}
\details{
This function validates that the layer names from the tmin input can be
converted to valid dates. It expects date names in a standard format
(e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD"). The function preserves the original date formatting
in the output layer names.
}
\note{
This function is designed to work with the \code{tmin_tmax_interpolation()}
framework and can be passed as the \code{interpol_fun} argument. When using
this interpolation method, set \code{daily_agg_fun = "none"} since the output
is already at daily resolution.
