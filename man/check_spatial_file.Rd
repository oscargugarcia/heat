\title{Check and Clean an sf Spatial Object}
\usage{
check_spatial_file(geometry, source = NULL, verbose = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{geometry}{An sf object to validate and clean.}

\item{source}{Optional character string describing the source (e.g., file path) for messaging.}
}
\value{
A cleaned and validated sf object with geometry in WGS84 (EPSG:4326).
}
\description{
This function performs validation and cleaning on an sf object. It sets or transforms the CRS
to WGS84 if needed, renames geometry columns, removes empty geometries, reports mixed geometry
types, applies \code{st_make_valid()} to polygons, wraps dateline crossings, and issues final validity
checks. Designed to be used both after reading files and when the user supplies an sf object
directly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Validate and clean an sf object
  cleaned_geometry <- check_spatial_file(my_geometry)
  
  # With source information for better error messages
  cleaned_geometry <- check_spatial_file(my_geometry, source = "my_data.gpkg")
}
