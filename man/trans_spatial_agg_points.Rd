\usage{
trans_spatial_agg_points(
  raster_subset,
  trans_fun,
  checked_trans_args,
  points_buffered,
  agg_weights,
  spatial_agg_args,
  geom_id_col,
  verbose = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster_subset}{A SpatRaster object containing multiple layers (time steps) of environmental data.}

\item{trans_fun}{A transformation function to apply to the extracted time series, or "none" for no transformation.}

\item{checked_trans_args}{A list of pre-validated arguments for the transformation function.}

\item{points_buffered}{An sf object containing pre-buffered point geometries (required).}

\item{agg_weights}{Not used for point geometries (included for compatibility with polygon version).}

\item{spatial_agg_args}{A list of spatial aggregation arguments (included for compatibility).}

\item{geom_id_col}{The name of the column in the points_buffered object that identifies each point.}

\item{verbose}{Integer verbosity level (0 = silent, 1 = concise, 2 = detailed).}
}
\value{
A data table containing the point identifiers, transformation variable indicators, and extracted/transformed values for each time step.
}
\description{
This helper function processes point geometries by extracting raster values directly at point locations, applying a specified transformation to the resulting time series, and formatting the output to match the structure of polygon-based aggregation. It is automatically called by \code{trans_spatial_agg()} when point geometries are detected. The function uses pre-buffered points that are created once at the beginning of processing for efficiency.
