\title{Create Periods from Boundary Dates}
\usage{
create_periods(boundary_dates)
}
\arguments{
\item{:}{\itemize{
\item boundary_dates: A sorted vector of dates (length >= 2) defining the breakpoints for periods.
}}
}
\value{
:
\itemize{
\item A data.frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{start_date}: The starting date of each period.
\item \code{end_date}: The ending date of each period (one day before the next boundary date, except for the last period).
}
}
}
\description{
This function generates a structured sequence of time periods based on a vector of boundary dates.
Given a sorted vector of dates, it constructs periods where each start date corresponds to a boundary
date, and the end date is one day before the next boundary date, except for the final period, which
ends exactly at the last boundary date.

  print(periods)
