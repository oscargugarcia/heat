\title{Read Spatial File (Polygons or Points)}
\usage{
read_spatial_file(file_path, validate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{A string specifying the path to the spatial data file.}

\item{validate}{Logical; if TRUE (default), validates and cleans the geometry using \code{check_spatial_file()}.}
}
\value{
An sf object with geometry in its original CRS, validated and cleaned.
Point and polygon geometries are both supported and processed accordingly.
}
\description{
Reads spatial data from a file (Parquet, GPKG, Shapefile, GeoJSON, FGB, RDS), converts the geometry
to an sf object. By default, validates and cleans the geometry using \code{check_spatial_file()}, which
validates that a CRS is defined, renames "geom" to "geometry", removes empty geometries, applies
st_make_valid() to polygons, and performs other validation steps. Validation can be disabled by
setting \code{validate = FALSE}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Read and validate (default)
  polygons <- read_spatial_file("data/polygons/CONUS_consistent_counties.gpkg")
  
  # Read without validation
  polygons_raw <- read_spatial_file("data/polygons/polygons.gpkg", validate = FALSE)
  
  points <- read_spatial_file("data/points/sampling_points.gpkg")
  rds_data <- read_spatial_file("data/spatial_data.rds")
}
