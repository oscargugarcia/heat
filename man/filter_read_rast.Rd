\title{Filter and Read Rasters}
\usage{
filter_read_rast(path, year_range = NULL, verbose = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string specifying the directory path containing raster files.}

\item{year_range}{A numeric vector of length 2 (optional). This vector specifies the year range to filter the raster files. If NULL (default), all files are loaded without filtering.}

\item{verbose}{Integer verbosity level (0 = silent, 1 = concise, 2 = detailed)}
}
\value{
A character vector of file paths corresponding to the raster files that were read. The files are loaded into memory as a list of raster objects.
}
\description{
This function loads files from a specified directory. It allows users to filter the files based on a year range, with the years inferred from the filenames, which are expected to be in the format 'yyyy.tif' or 'yyyy.nc'. If no filtering range is provided, all available raster files will be read. The function prints informative messages detailing the loading process, including the path and names of the files being read.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Load all secondary weight rasters
  all_rasters <- filter_read_sec_weights("path/to/rasters/")
  
  # Load secondary weight rasters filtered by year range
  filtered_rasters <- filter_read_sec_weights("path/to/rasters/", c(1970, 2010))
}
