# `heat` : Harmonized Environmental Exposure Aggregation Tools

[![](https://zenodo.org/badge/1113902927.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17882617)

The `heat` R package provides a comprehensive set of tools to compute environmental exposures for administrative boundaries or point locations. Its main aggregation function, `r2e2`, supports various nonlinear transformations (e.g., polynomial, splines, binning), temporal aggregations (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly), and scales efficiently to large raster datasets spanning multiple decades.

## Installation

``` r
# Install devtools if needed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install heat
devtools::install_github("echolab-stanford/heat")
```

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Polynomial Transformation and Aggregation to Monthly 
``` r
library(heat)
library(sf)
library(terra)

# Load dataframe containing an sf geometry (polygons or points)
regions <- st_read("regions.shp")

# Load environmental raster
temperature <- rast("temperature.tif")

# Polynomial transformation and aggregation to monthly 
exposures <- r2e2(
  env_rast = temperature,            # Environmental raster
  geometry = regions,                # Spatial geometries
  trans_type = "polynomial",         # Transformation type
  degree = 4,                        # Polynomial degree
  out_temp_res = "monthly"           # Aggregate to monthly
)
```
```r
# Access results
head(exposures$monthly_long)

#>   geom_id  trans_type    date  year month   degree_1 degree_2   degree_3 degree_4
#>    <char>      <char>  <fctr> <int> <int>      <num>    <num>      <num>    <num> 
#>  region_1  polynomial 1999-12  1999    12  0.3703647 35.44290  42.662160 2277.396 
#>  region_1  polynomial 2000-01  2000     1 -0.9477844 37.63980 -50.418337 2270.166
#>  region_1  polynomial 2000-02  2000     2 -1.2895124 36.79065 -75.434199 2400.315
#>  region_2  polynomial 1999-12  1999    12  0.1551976 31.36412  33.632878 1814.176
#>  region_2  polynomial 2000-01  2000     1  0.4783851 28.49742   7.187916 1652.574
```

### Example 2: Binning with Secondary Weights

``` r
# Population-weighted temperature aggregation
exposures <- r2e2(
  env_rast = "path/to/temperature/",           # A directory name works too
  sec_weight_rast = "path/to/population/",     # ... also for secondary weights
  geometry = "path/to/regions.shp",            # ... and spatial geometries
  geom_id_col = "region_id",                   # Optional: keep only ID column
  start_date = "2000-01-01",                   # Optional: Filter raster date range
  end_date = "2020-12-31",                     # Default: full date range
  out_format = "all",                          # Both 'long' and 'wide' output               
  trans_type = "bin",                          # Bin transformation
  breaks = c(-10, 0, 10, 20, 30),              # Bin breaks
  out_temp_res = "daily",                      # Keep daily resolution
  save_path = "path/to/output",                # Save outputs locally
  verbose = 2                                  # Show detailed messages
)
```

## `r2e2()`: Raster to Environmental Exposures

The `r2e2` function of the `heat` package aggregates environmental raster data to environmental exposures following these three steps:

1. **Transformation**: Applies the specified nonlinear transformation to each raster cell's time series.
2. **Spatial Aggregation**: Averages the transformed raster values over each geometry using `exactextractr`, optionally using secondary weights.
3. **Temporal Aggregation**: Aggregates the spatially averaged values to the desired temporal resolution (e.g., monthly, yearly).

For a great explanation of these operations and why their order matters, please refer to [Lidell et al. (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815224002639). The `r2e2` part of the `heat` package closely aligns in purpose with their `stagg` package but aims to provide a faster, more robust approach. `heat` also extends the `stagg` functionality with these additional features:



-  Batch processing: Enables fast processing across multiple decades on regular laptops and high-performance computing clusters
-  Smart restart: Automatically resumes from last successful batch when re-running after interruption (see performance tips below)
-  Support for temporal resolutions from sub-hourly to yearly in the input environmental raster 
-  Built-in plots to validate the quality of the output and visualize the exposure distributions
-  Integrated support for time-varying secondary weights (e.g., yearly population counts)
-  Raster interpolations: Mean daily temperature, or sinusoidal hourly temperature, interpolated from daily min and max temperature
-  Long and wide output formats
-  User provided custom transformation functions on top of standard built-in transformations (Polynomial, Splines, Binning)
-  Custom arguments can be passed to the transformation functions and the spatial aggregation via `exact_extract()` to customize the processing

We are currently finishing up additional functions downstream of `r2e2` such as calculating unit specific lags.

| `"polynomial"`     | Polynomial     | `stats::poly()`  | `degree = <integer>`  |
| `"natural_spline"` | Natural cubic spline     | `splines::ns()`  | `knots = c(...)`      |
| `"b_spline"`       | B-spline           | `splines::bs()`  | `knots = c(...)`      |

### Input Data Requirements

#### Environmental Raster

A raster (`SpatRaster` object), or a directory name of either GeoTIFF (`.tif`) or NetCDF (`.nc`) raster files meeting the following requirements:

-   Longitude Format: Must use -180 to 180 degrees (not 0 to 360). Use `terra::rotate()` to convert if needed.
-   Layer Names: Must be dates in format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY` (e.g., `2020-01-15 12:00`, `2020-01-15`, `2020-01`, `2020`). It also works if the time dimension (`terra::time(raster)`) instead of the layernames contains the time steps.
-   Coverage: Will be cropped to the geometry's extent automatically but must overlap with it.
-   Subdaily Aggregation: Sub-daily data (e.g. hourly) can be aggregated to daily using `daily_agg_fun = "mean"` or `"sum"`. This step is done before the transformation and speeds up the processing without introducing bias. 

These requirements are automatically checked within `r2e2()`, but can be checked separately:

``` r
# Validate raster structure
env_rast <- rast("path/to/climate/data/")
check_raster(env_rast)                     # Checks longitude, layer names, temporal resolution
```

#### Secondary Weight Rasters (Optional)

Used to weight spatial aggregation (e.g., population-weighted averages). Same format and requirements as environmental raster data, except:

-   Values: Should be positive (e.g., population counts, crop areas)
-   CRS: Ideally matches environmental raster CRS. If not, will be reprojected to match environmental raster CRS using bilinear projection.
-   Resolution: Will be resampled (using `terra::resample(.., method = "average")`) to match environmental raster resolution.

**Note**: Secondary weight layers split up the environmental raster into weighting periods. Each weight layer creates a separate period with the layers of the environmental raster that are closest to it in time. 


#### Spatial Geometries

A `sf` object (polygons or points) or path to spatial file (`.gpkg`, `.shp`, `.geojson`, `.json`, `.fgb`, `.rds`, `.parquet`) meeting the following requirements:

-   CRS: Any valid CRS is accepted, will be reprojected to match environmental raster CRS automatically.
-   ID Column: Ideally a unique identifier column (specified via `geom_id_col`). If no ID column is provided, the row index will be used and all columns retained.
-   Geometry Type: POLYGON, MULTIPOLYGON, POINT, or MULTIPOINT

Validation is executed automatically within `r2e2()`, but can be run separately:
``` r
# Validate and clean spatial geometries
regions <- st_read("regions.gpkg")
validated_regions <- check_spatial_file(regions)  # Checks CRS, validates geometries
```



### Output Formats

Depending on the input resolution and chosen temporal aggregation, results include:

-   `daily_long`: Long format (rows: geometry-date pairs) in daily resolution.
-   `daily_wide`: Wide format (rows: geometry, columns: dates) in daily resolution. 
-   `monthly_long`: Long format in monthly resolution. See Example 1 above.
-    ...
-   `yearly_wide`: Wide format in yearly resolution
-   `area_weights`: Area weights for each geometry-cell pair

**Example:** 

- Input: daily data, `out_temp_res = "monthly"` → outputs: `daily_wide`, `daily_long`, `monthly_wide`, `monthly_long`.
- Choose output format with `out_format = "wide"`, `"long"`, or `"all"`. 
- Saved files use the same naming: `daily_long.parquet`, `monthly_wide.parquet`, etc.


## Validation

### Built-in Validation

Enable built-in validation to visualize and verify your results during processing:

``` r
exposures <- r2e2(
  env_rast = temperature,
  geometry = regions,
  geom_id_col = "region_id",
  trans_type = "polynomial",
  degree = 4,
  out_temp_res = "monthly",
  validation = TRUE,                         # Generate validation plots
  validation_var = "degree_1",               # Variable to visualize
  validation_var_name = "Temperature (°C)",  # Variable name for plots
  verbose = 1
)
```

### Validation after processing

Validation can also be run separately on existing results:

``` r
# Validate after processing
validate_r2e2(
  results = exposures,                       # Output from r2e2()
  geometry = regions,
  geom_id_col = "region_id",
  validation_var = "degree_1",               # Variable to visualize
  validation_var_name = "Temperature (°C)"   # Variable name for plots
)
```

Validation produces plots showing: 

- Maps of spatial averages and missing values
- Time series visualizing trends over the years
- Summary statistics and seasonal distributions 
- Grid cell alignment verification 
- Cell count diagnostics


## Interpolation

For raster datasets with only daily minimum and maximum values (e.g., `tmin` and `tmax`), `heat` provides interpolation functions to estimate hourly or mean daily values:

- **`mean_interpol()`**: Simple average of min and max for daily mean values
- **`sinusoidal_interpol()`**: Sinusoidal curve fitting for hourly estimates

### Example: Interpolating to Hourly Temperature

``` r
# Interpolate hourly temperature from tmin and tmax
hourly_temp <- interpol_min_max(
  min_rast_path = "path/to/tmin/",
  max_rast_path = "path/to/tmax/",
  geometry = regions,
  interpol_fun = sinusoidal_interpol,   # Use sinusoidal interpolation
)

# Get binned distribution within a day from the hourly data
exposures <- r2e2(
  env_rast = hourly_temp,
  geometry = regions,
  trans_type = "bin",
  breaks = c(-10, 0, 10, 20, 30),
  out_temp_res = "daily"                 # Aggregate back to daily
)
```


## Performance Tips

-   Use `max_cells` to control memory usage. Default are 30 million (`3e7`) cells processed at once. Lower values will decrease memory usage.
-   Set `verbose = 2` for detailed progress information and debugging.
-   For points, the package automatically uses an optimized extraction method
-   Enable smart restart, which automatically resumes from the last successful batch when re-running after an interruption. This is enabled by default when a `save_path` is provided, `save_batch_output = TRUE`, and `overwrite_batch_output = FALSE`.
-   If the polygons are far apart, e.g. spanning multiple countries or continents, the soon to be released `r2e2_country()` function will accelerate processing by splitting the raster by country.
